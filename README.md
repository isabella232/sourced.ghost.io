## source{d} Ghost Theme Assets, Dependencies & Configurations

This repo gathers source{d} Ghost Theme configuration instructions, depedent assets and contributing guidelines, and the Theme itself. 

### Instructions

- To update the source{d} Ghost Theme, the entire [ghost-theme directory](https://github.com/src-d/sourced.ghost.io/tree/master/ghost-theme) should be ziped and uploaded/updated on Ghost -> Settings -> Design.

- The [docs directory](https://github.com/src-d/sourced.ghost.io/tree/master/docs/README.md) has the assets that are depentents on source{d} Landing, in order to brand-wise comply with the current/updated Landing Identity, [Landing's External Dependents](https://github.com/src-d/landing/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#external-dependents) must be taken into cosideration.

- You can find Ghost Theme Settings Instructions on [ghost-settigns directory](https://github.com/src-d/sourced.ghost.io/tree/master/ghost-settings/README.md).

- Current source{d} Ghost Theme Styles are defined [on this directory](https://github.com/src-d/sourced.ghost.io/tree/master/assets/scss) and use some of Landign's Styles, mainly of the Header & Footer. You can find bellow some forward thinking on this matter.

### Considerations

Ghost Theme presentation styles inherit source{d} Landing styles, mainly on the Header and Footer. In a near future the styles from /landing/styles/build.css will come from landing/src/css/parts/header.css and landing/src/css/parts/footer.css. Therefore, this will be taken into accounnt soon, and we must act accordingly when updating Ghost Theme.
