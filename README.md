## source{d} Ghost Theme Assets, Dependencies & Configurations

This repo gathers source{d} Ghost Theme configuration instructions, dependent assets and contributing guidelines, and the Theme itself. 

### Instructions

- To update the source{d} Ghost Theme, the entire [ghost-theme directory](/ghost-theme) should be zipped and uploaded/updated on Ghost -> Settings -> Design.

- The [docs directory](/docs) has the assets that depend on source{d} Landing, in order to brand-wise comply with the current/updated Landing Identity, [Landing's External Dependents](https://github.com/src-d/landing/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#external-dependents) must be taken into consideration.

- You can find Ghost Theme Settings Instructions on [ghost-settings directory](/ghost-settings).

- Current source{d} Ghost Theme Styles are defined on [ghost-theme styles directory](/ghost-theme/assets/scss) and use some of Landing's Styles, mainly of the Header & Footer. You can find below some forward thinking on this matter.

### Considerations

Ghost Theme presentation styles were crafted based on source{d} Landing styles at [src-d/landing/src/sass](https://github.com/src-d/landing/tree/master/src/sass) and modified according to source{d} Blog specific necessities, and can be found on [ghost-theme styles directory](/ghost-theme/assets/scss). This should be taken into account when updating Ghost Theme.
